Recently, emphasis on equity in mathematics education has increased. These recommendations-authentic prac- tices and equity-raise questions. How does one "see" equity in the classroom? How does one interpret authenticity? And are authentic mathematical practices and equity compatible? Focus has shifted to the view that becoming a mathematician (or learning mathe- matics) does not simply mean acquiring a body of mathematical knowledge and skills, but rather acquiring "mathematical habits of mind" (Cuoco, 1998) or "mathe- matical dispositions" (Schoenfeld, 1992). Social practice theorists-and a grow- ing number of educators-realize that mathematics is a social activity, a matter of beliefs, habits, and dispositions as well as skills (Cobb, 1996; Hall, 1996; Hall & Stevens, 1995; Lampert, 1997; Lave, 1988; Schoenfeld, 1992). If so, then- we may do well to conceive of mathematics education less as an instructional process (in the traditional sense of teaching specific, well-defined skills or items of knowledge), than as a socialization process. In this conception, people develop points of view and behavior patterns associated with gender roles, ethnic and familial cultures, and other socially defined traits. (Resnick, 1988, p. 58 as cited in Schoenfeld, 1992) When mathematicians are engaged in actual processes of constructing mathe- matical knowledge, they make conjectures, test them against counterexamples or try to prove them, and revise their initial conjectures in an iterative process. Some mathematics educators have suggested that the goal of teaching mathematics should be "to bring the practice of knowing mathematics in school closer to what it means to know mathematics within the discipline" (Lampert, 1990; see also Ball, 1993, 1995; Cobb, Wood, & Yackel, 1991; Richards, 1991). One of the major ways to do so is to introduce students to the language and usage-the discourse- of the discipline. For example, the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics' Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for School Mathematics (1989) called for children to "talk mathematics" and for teachers to help them construct knowledge, learn to think in multiple ways about ideas, reflect on their own thinking, develop convincing arguments, and eventually extend the arguments to deductive proofs.p. [127] 128 Equity in a Mathematics Classroom: An Exploration One result of this reform effort has been the suggestion that students construct and produce their own knowledge rather than receive "ready made" knowledge (NCTM, 2000). Recently, a growing number of mathematics educators have recognized the need to move toward more equitable mathematics education (Ball, 2003; Linn & Kessel, 1996; Schoenfeld, 2002). Ball, for example, questions the relative silence of the mathematics education community. Echoing George Hein she asks, "How do concerns for equity play a role in the design of our efforts to improve mathe- matics and science instruction?" She suggests going beyond the rhetoric of "all students" or "high expectations" to address the "vast problems of educational in- equalities that permeate U.S. schooling" (Ball, 2003). Many reform initiatives reflect this trend. For example, Principles and Standards for School Mathematics (NCTM, 2000) includes a separate Equity Principle: "Excellence in mathematics education requires equity-high expectations and strong support for all students." Mathematicians and mathematics educators agree that "all students must have a solid grounding in mathematics to function effec- tively in today's world. The need to improve the learning of traditionally under- served groups of students is widely recognized; efforts to do so must continue" (Ball, Ferrini-Mundy, Kilpatrick, Milgram, Schmid, & Schaar, 2005, p. 2). Although we hear a growing call for equity in mathematics education, we still need to explore what it looks like in practice. Schoenfeld notes that "like its an- tecedent [the NCTM 1989 Standards document], Principles and Standards can (despite its nearly 400 pages of densely packed text) be accused of being long on vision and somewhat short on detail. It identifies some essential goals, but does not provide a blueprint for achieving them" (2002, p. 15). This chapter illustrates ways to look at how both equity and "authentic" mathe- matical practices play out in the daily interactions of a classroom. It examines some of the practices adapted from the mathematical community through minute- by-minute interactions in the classroom to better understand-and raise questions about-the social practice of mathematics and mathematics education. I share ways to examine and analyze interactions, providing a grounded framework for exploring classroom activity, to move us toward more equitable practices in the mathematics classroom. THEORETICAL BACKGROUND My examination of classroom interactions is guided by two theoretical perspec- tives: social practice theory and science studies. My analysis also draws on socio- linguistic tools aligned with those theoretical frameworks. Those frameworks are by no means independent of each other. Instead, they are "irreductionist" frame- works (Kaghan & Bowker, 2000) that account for individual agency as well as social structure and view a social order as continually produced and reproduced through ongoing practices and interactions.p. 128 Tamar Posner 129 Social Practice Theory In this chapter, I use the concept of social practice to account for the complexity of human thought and actions as they take place in everyday life (Lave, 1988). The premise of social practice theory is that every activity-including the practice of school mathematics-is socially situated and occurs in a specific time and place, under particular historical and political conditions. (For example, the No Child Left Behind Act is a recent political condition that has had a direct influence on public school practices.) To understand social practice, one must look at what people do and say in their daily practices, and attend to politics and inequalities in resources and power. Social practice theories highlight the interdependency of agency and structure, and seek to describe the dialectical relationship between them and understand the "interweaving of personal life and social structure" (Connell, 1987, p. 61). Those theories go beyond the dichotomy of structural determinism and psycho- logical theories of agency. Understanding the relationship between social structure and individual actions is not a trivial matter. For example, to theorize this inter- dependency Giddens (1984) developed structuration theory, based on the idea that structure both influences and is influenced by human actions. In his view, actions have both intended and unintended consequences, and actors know much but not all about the structural ramifications of their actions. In another attempt to theorize the relationship between agency and structure, Bourdieu (1977) introduced the concept of habitus, which is a system of disposi- tions, a set of acquired patterns of thought, behaviors, and tastes that constitute the link between social structures and human actions. For example, a child who grows up in a family and culture that strongly believes in creationism and goes to a school that emphasizes the theory of evolution might not easily understand the teacher's scientific discourse, might rely on different material to make meaning (Bible vs. scientific documents), and might feel alienated in terms of beliefs. The consequences of paying attention to those differences can be significant in terms of student participation in the classroom, and beyond. Many studies indicate that children often experience difficulty in classrooms that are organized according to assumptions about the use of time, space, language, and instructional strategies that are different from those in their homes (Heath, 1983; Labov, 1970; Martin, 2000; McCollum, 1989; Philips, 1970; Willis, 1981). Although some studies attribute poor achievement to individual characteristics, social practice theorists closely examine the social and historical conditions un- der which students operate and have found other explanations. For example, Paul Willis studied working class boys in England. Through an examination of students' day-to-day interactions and the educational and social systems, he found that underachievement was related to their poor and working class background and was more often a result of rebellion against school authority than ability. Moreover, he argues that their rebellious behavior prepares them (sometimes consciously, sometime not) for working-class jobs. Willis found that working-class boys (thep. 129 130 Equity in a Mathematics Classroom: An Exploration "lads") tended to articulate a counter-school culture, which in its most basic di- mension is "entrenched general and personalized opposition to 'authority"' (1981, p. 11). The lads resisted with "a continuous scraping of chairs," "continuous fidg- eting," "comic newspapers and nudes under half-lifted desks melt into elusive textbooks," and more. In contrast, the conformists ("the ear'oles") "invest[ed] in this formal structure, and in exchange for some loss of autonomy accept[ed] the official guardians to keep the holy rules" (p. 22). They paid attention, their gaze was focused on the teacher, and they did homework. Other studies have described how African-American students are ridiculed by one another for "acting white," which is defined as behaviors characteristic of Caucasian students, for example, getting good grades, liking classical music, raising their hands in class, and dress- ing in a certain way. Social practice theorists argue that such day-to-day interac- tions contribute to the production and reproduction of social structures. The foregoing two examples identify social trends and cannot be assumed true for every member of a particular group. Although class, gender, or race may play a role, individual agency cannot be neglected. For example, Martin (2000) studied African American middle school students who succeeded in mathematics. Although some of their peers viewed success in mathematics as "acting white," the students studied had strategies that allowed them to simultaneously achieve academic suc- cess and social survival. Many maintained small friendship groups of "nerds" or "good kids," and dismissed the ridicule of "bad kids." Grantham-Campbell (2005) focused on successful Native Alaskan students and the cultural processes involved in their success. She found that Native students who succeed in "doing school" are able to suspend incidents of cultural conflict and maintain a calculated mistrust of the schooling process. These same students are able to separate from the dominant "image" of Natives and cultivate an "identity" drawn from positive experiences and relationships. For example, when a student council calendar used a photograph of Natives drinking, a Native student, in an act of defiance, dressed traditionally to counter the negative representation of Native people. Science Studies To make sense of classroom interactions, I also draw on a body of work-sci- ence studies-that analyzes science as a social practice. This branch of science studies focuses on examining the processes through which scientific knowledge is produced. The approaches taken by science studies scholars vary, but to some de- gree, they all assume that scientific knowledge-as well as other knowledge-is socially constructed-"made" collectively by many actors, both nonhuman and human. Those researchers investigate how claims become "facts," and how and why credit is allocated. I borrow these notions, and take the perspective that sci- entific "facts" are constructed by multiple actors. Science studies researchers view scientific knowledge not as inevitable discov- eries, but rather as productions of social, cultural, and material processes. Often "scientific facts" are understood as claims about truth. Many science studiesp. 130 Tamar Posner 131 scholars view such claims in a pragmatic way-meaning that a scientific claim is "true" if it "works" to the extent that relevant communities believe the claim. In that way "truth" is viewed as an historical construction, which can explain how knowledge is actually produced and claims become facts. Early science studies focused on "science in the making." Through ethnographic- style fieldwork in laboratories, researchers made detailed accounts of the con- struction of scientific facts (Knorr-Cetina, 1981; Latour, 1979; Lynch, 1994) that described how scientific knowledge is accomplished through messy work. They found that successful scientific practice depends on multiple factors absent from positivist accounts of science. What emerged from these studies is that scientific facts are neither given nor discovered, but rather are outcomes of complex nego- tiation processes. One of the first studies of this kind was Laboratory Life (1979). It describes the process by which scientific facts in a biology laboratory were gradually stripped of the conditions under which they were developed and became "black boxes" claims whose validity and interual nature were not questioned. Latour argues (1986) that a claim alone is neither fact nor fiction; instead it is made so by other claims. Making a scientific fact includes gathering sufficient resources, enrolling or enlisting allies (human and nonhuman), and persuading others that the claim is a fact. Common ways to enroll allies (both human and nonhuman) are to cite other papers; use specific representations, such as graphs; drop names; and be as- sociated with authoritative figures in the field. In short, the construction of a fact depends on interpretations and on who picks it up. Claims may involve dissent-a minority perspective that challenges a majority opinion. Dissent within science is expected. It plays dual roles: delegitimizing particular claims by exposing missing evidence or faulty thinking and legitimizing science as an institutionalized form of truth-seeking that evolves with new information. Latour also describes the process through which a scientific statement goes through different modalities as it becomes a "hard fact"-from speculative hy- pothesis to proved statement to unspoken assumption. The modalities of a state- ment are modified through scrutiny in laboratories and conferences: how other scientists in the field cite it, certify it by assuming it is proved, and finally just assume that it is true. A scientific fact (black box) may spread to multiple commu- nities yet have different meanings in each, becoming in Latour's words an "immu- table mobile." Einstein's relativity theory as commonly understood is an example of an immutable mobile. Assigning credit and invisible work Steven Shapin (1989) documented instances of how 17th century chemist Francis Boyle assigned credit. Technicians were credited only when mistakes were made. When experiments went well, Boyle took full credit and the technicians were not mentioned. Other scholars have noted that an idea or a concept is rarely, if ever, developed solely by an individual and that making a fact includes erasurep. 131 132 Equity in a Mathematics Classroom: An Exploration of elements that made it a "hard fact." Star (1991) calls these erased elements "in- visible work." Once an idea is attributed to an individual, we often create a history in which other contributors become invisible and their contributions are erased (see, for example, Latour & Woolgar, 1979; Latour, 1987; Star, 1991a, 1991b; Strauss et al., 1985; Traweek, 1988). Researchers have documented how work done by members of specific groups may become invisible: "rendering certain kinds of work invisible, reifying invis- ible things, and then secretly, privately, or duplicitously claiming the resources rightfully belonging to the work" and to the workers, who are often members of a marginalized group (Star, 1991, p. 279). This finding is consistent with findings of studies of women who enter such male-dominated professions as science and firefighting (Chetkovich, 1997; Eisenhart & Finkel, 1998; Ong, 2002; Traweek, 1988). For example, Chetkovich (1997) found that women firefighters were made invisible in different ways: excluded from conversations, spoken about as if they were not present, and denied credit for work they did in the firehouse. Classroom studies reveal that when females demonstrate competence in mathematics and science classrooms, teachers and male peers often refuse to acknowledge their achievements, and the girls themselves downplay their own ability. Moreover, they often deliberately position themselves to resolve such tension, usually by opting out of the conversation (Elkjaer, 1992; Ong, 2002, Tobias, 1990; Volman et al., 1999). Sociolinguistic tools Social practice theory-combined with science studies-offers productive theoretical orientations for exploring classroom discussion. Studies conducted by sociolinguists and educational ethnographers offer tools for analysis that are aligned with those frameworks. Sociolinguists consider power relationships to understand patterns in communication. For example, they look at utterances in conversations, patterns of utterances, and conditions under which utterances are produced, for example, getting the floor. I briefly outline some of their approach- es, including the patterns of communication, discourse of disagreements, use of turns of talk, and register. Patterns of communication: Everyday and classroom Although I do not seek to perpetuate stereotypical behaviors, an important point to recognize is that communication in the reformed classroom may reproduce everyday patterns of communication. Lakoff (1975) argues that in general, fe- males belittle and indicate doubt about the ideas they share more often than males do. Males are also seen as pursuing status by trying to win debates about ideas (Tannen, 1990; Tannen & Bly, 1993). In studies of classrooms, Noddings (1992) found that females' patterns of communication are less direct (and less aggressive) than males' patterns. Phelan (1993) talks about the ways females act incompetent- ly and rely on the knowledge of boys who act competently in science classrooms.p. 132 Tamar Posner 133 These and other studies, for example, Cockburn (1985), Goffinan (1977), Lie (1995), and Ong (2002), portray traditional gender roles in which females are de- picted as generally supportive collaborators in classroom interactions. Conversely, males are generally portrayed as dominant individuals, obtaining, directing, and holding the conversational floor for extended periods. A number of secondary school studies illustrate how gender influences the in- teractions in mathematics and science classrooms (Brophy, Guzzeti, & Williams, 1996; Kahle, 1990; Morse & Handley, 19985; Tobin & Garnett, 1987). Ong's study of undergraduate female minority students in physics explored the multiple strategies those students employed to "perform invisibility," including not taking responsibility for their own stances, bringing their own opinions in the names of others, and disengaging from discussions when they felt confronted in public. Lee (2004) also suggests that East Asian discourse is in general cooperative and harmonious, owing to its emphasis on "saving face." Some of those findings have led to reforms intended to foster greater equity and close the achievement gap, such as sex-segregated mathematics and science pro- grams in middle schools, and the creation of such programs as EQUALS. Those approaches are designed to restructure patterns of communication and increase the participation and engagement of typically nondominant participants. Discourse of disagreements Research on disagreements in everyday settings shows that often those who dis- agree try to mask their disagreement by restating, pausing, and self-repairing, for example, "um that, that one, [pause] um-zero has to be an odd, an even number." Moreover, the initial disagreeing party will often avoid using the term "disagree" because holding a disagreeing position can be uncomfortable (Davidson, 1984; Goodwin & Goodwin, 1987; Pomerantz, 1984). However, public disagreements in a classroom setting during lessons on sub- ject matter reveal a different pattern. Engle and Greeno (1994) differentiate con- ceptual based disagreements from interpersonal disagreements. In contrast with tentative and uncomfortable discourse displayed in interpersonal disagreements, participants in "conceptual based" disagreements quite eagerly engage in and an- nounce their disagreements. Conceptual based disagreements follow the norm to "challenge ideas, not people," allowing safer participation-whereas interperson- al disagreements are mainly driven by personal, everyday reasons. Whereas con- ceptual based disagreements focus on explanations of concepts (in this chapter, on mathematical concepts), Engle and Greeno note that they also include social and interpersonal motivations that are managed in different ways than interpersonal "everyday" disagreements. They argue that participants in conceptually focused disagreements need to simultaneously satisfy multiple interpersonal and concep- tual goals. For conceptual based conversation to be successful, participants must find ways to make their conceptual disagreements explicit while avoiding having it threaten the face-saving of the party they disagree with.p. 133 134 Equity in a Mathematics Classroom: An Exploration Lampert, Rittenhouse, and Crumbaugh (1996) have noted that the public airing, criticizing, and defending of ideas during public class discussions can potentially disrupt friendships and social relationships, especially if others lose face (Goffman, 1972). Furthermore, people may vary in their tolerance of, and comfort with, dis- agreement. Such variation may have its roots in habitus-individual dispositions or preferences of sociocultural groups. Important considerations in examining equity issues in the mathematics classroom are to discern the multiple reasons for engag- ing in public disagreements and to explore the habitus of the players. Turns of talk Everyday conversation is composed of speech between at least two people, or- ganized by turns. The turn is the period of talk for each speaker. Ideally, one per- son speaks at a time; but this is not always so in a discussion. In formal situations, such as public lecture or rituals, turns of talk are often allocated by a facilitator or predetermined according to participants' roles. In an unstructured, spontane- ous conversation, however, participants must determine in the moment when it is appropriate to take a turn. Sacks, Schegloff, and Jefferson (1974) suggest that certain rules govern the turn allocations in a conversation. Classrooms may be unique because they are neither "formal" nor "informal." Sociolinguistic studies in education explore turns of talk and how they are allocat- ed in the classroom. Verplae (2000) classifies the allocation of classroom talk into four distinct types: (1) the teacher's selection of a child who has not volunteered, (2) the student's response to the teacher's bid, (3) a student's request to speak while others are speaking (e. g., by raising his or her hand), and (4) a student's interrup- tion of another speaker and the teacher's permission to that student to continue. Philips describes different strategies used by students to take a turn of talk dur- ing classroom discussion. She also points out the unique situation in classroom discussions, in which the teacher plays an important role in allocating turns to talk. Schuman argues that a count of the number of turns taken by a participant is insufficient, rather one should ask how that student obtained the privilege to get the floor or, even more revealing, to take it. A number of studies rely on turns of talk, length of turns, talk interruptions, and the teacher's nomination to the speaking floor to analyze how such issues as gender and race play into classroom interactions (Bousted, 1989; Kramarae & Treichler, 1990; Sadker & Sadker, 1990; Spender & Sarah, 1980). They found that students' cultural backgrounds, gender-in general what we might call their habi- tuses-were correlated with the kinds of interactions they had in the classroom. These studies often adopt the perspective that the classroom is a microculture of the outside world, in which talk may form an important arena for the reproduction of gender, race, and class inequalities in human relations and social interaction (Baxter, 1999, p. 83). A study by LaFrance showed that when compared with males in classroom dis- cussion, females rarely are nominated to talk, talk less when they have the floor,p. 134 Tamar Posner 135 and are interrupted more often (LaFrance, 1991). Similarly, Jones (1989) found that during classroom discussions, fewer females than males initiate questions or call out answers. Biggs and Edwards (1994) observed that teachers in multiethnic primary school classrooms interacted less frequently with children of color and that interactions with those students were less elaborate and shorter in duration. Teachers are important figures in the classroom. Lampert (1990) notes, "The teacher has more power over how acts and utterances get interpreted, being in a position of social and intellectual authority, but these interpretations are finally the result of negotiation with students about how the activity is to be regarded" (pp. 34-35). Register The linguistic term register refers to the particular kind of language used in specific situational contexts. Particular kinds of activities require particular kinds of language. Often the nature of an activity can be determined by the style of lan- guage used during the activity. In this sense, language reflects the activity. The mathematics register is made up of specific uses of language for mathemat- ical purposes. It includes the words and syntax of spoken and written mathematics and their meanings. An implicit requirement to use language in certain ways exists in the mathematics classroom. Teachers introduce and model "mathematical" lan- guage. In part, learning school mathematics involves learning a specific register. The school mathematics register has a specialized vocabulary and syntax. It contains both discipline-specific language (e.g., isosceles, pi) as well as words used in everyday language (e.g., odd, even, complex). For example, the word show in the context of a mathematics lesson often means to prove or justify an idea. However, in an everyday context, it can mean to "display" or "point out." Although certain features of the mathematics register can be isolated and identi- fied, the language used in mathematics classrooms cannot be regarded as a fixed or distinct set of words. Young students may sometimes conflate meanings of mathematical terms they learn in school with everyday meanings, or they may use two different meanings of a word in the same sentence. One example comes from a student in the lesson that is the subject of this chapter. Figure 4.1 shows two dif- ferent meanings of the word halves, which she wrote in her journal. In this description, "split in hafe" might have the everyday sense of two equal pieces of the whole (in this instance, the four circles), but the "hafes" refer to frac- tions-one of two equal pieces of a circle. Figure 4.1. A student's journal entrygiving two different meanings of the word halves.p. 135 136 Equity in a Mathematics Classroom: An Exploration In this chapter, I consider school mathematics as a social practice in which teach- ers and learners use language to construct mathematical meaning. Mathematical meaning is constructed in part through specific linguistic practices associated with a mathematical register; moreover, learning mathematics is very much a matter of learning to speak using the appropriate register in the classroom. METHODS To understand the 6-minute segment in terms of classroom history, I grounded my findings with a larger-scale analysis of the whole lesson of January 19 and other supplemental data. By traversing past, present, and future accounts, I was able to view the 6-minute segment within a broader context. In recent studies, educational researchers (e.g., Hall, 1996, 1999; Roth & McGinn, 1998) have focused attention on the material resources-such represen- tations as the number line and classroom drawings, and such written materials as student journals-that mediate learning. I examined how classroom participants used talk and representations as they engaged in what seemed to be "mathemati- cal" disagreements and tried to make sense of the classroom discussion. To analyze the 6 minutes of video, I borrowed sociolinguistic methods. These include transcribing the episode with attention to details, such as how conversa- tions were initiated, turns of talk, interruptions, speech repairs, and some attention to intonations, gestures, and duration of pauses (Goodwin & Heritage, 1990; Hall, 1996; McNeill, 1992; Sacks et al., 1974). Those methods aim to explicate how people produce interactions and what they accomplish in and through them, and can provide a lens to view the roles, social relationships, and power relationships among participants. I employed a 6-step process. First, I used a detailed transcription developed by a colleague and myself (Posner & Horn, 1996) according to Ochs's (1979) conven- tions. In addition, I paid attention to the gestures, physical orientation, and mate- rial resources visible in the conversation, as well as to vocal elements. Although I use some different conventions in some transcript excerpts, for the convenience of the reader the line numbers of the transcripts correspond with those used in other chapters of this monograph. However, I have sometimes included additional details about classroom actions that help clarify the analysis. Second, to situate the given segment within a larger context, I examined participants' interactions within the 6 minutes in search of clues about classroom practices and history that con- tributed to the shape of the conversation. Third, I proceeded to find other examples of those practices in the rest of the available data. Fourth, I followed participants' utterances-as well as possible-into the recent past, because they were asked to reflect about the previous lesson. Examining transcripts from the available previ- ous lessons provided some of the shared history in this classroom. Fifth, I focused on a detailed analysis of two sections of the 6-minute segment. My sixth step involved an examination of previous lessons. In the midst of the analysis, I realized that to better understand the meaning participants made outp. 136 Tamar Posner 137 of the conversation, I needed to explore their participation prior to this segment to sharpen my interpretation. The sixth step turned the analysis around because it allowed me to eliminate interpretations of events in the given segment that were erroneous owing to lack of context about the scope and sequence of mathematical conversation. As much as possible, I tried to take into account the possible influences on classroom interactions. To do so, I relied on the research described previously on patterns of interactions in society, particularly in classrooms. One could argue that we do not have enough "evidence" to explain how such categories as race and gender play into the interactions discussed in this chapter. Nonetheless, failing to consider equity issues does not solve the problem. Research suggests that children are aware at all times of race and gender (Pollack, 2004). In particular, children from nondominant groups are aware if the person speaking is African American, Asian, or a girl. We have no reason to assume that this classroom is significantly different. Because race and gender are part of students' identities, part of their habituses, the power of those social dynamics is important to recognize. However, I want to be clear that given the available data, my analysis is by no means an attempt to give an account of what "really" happened in this classroom. As the other chapters of this monograph indicate, the events can be interpreted in different ways. Researchers have noted (Hall, 1999; Jordan & Henderson, 1995) that analyzing a segment of conversation without understanding its context can result in mis- interpretation, even if we assume that participants in some instances are exhibit- ing the methods by which they carried out the activity. Moreover, by close analy- sis of talk in interactions out of context, we might end up with what Hall (1999) describes as "the crisis of interchangeability." That is, insufficient context may render the activities of different people indistinguishable. The question of what constitutes enough context (Latour, 1987; Ortner, 1984) always lingers. The contextual boundaries I have drawn in this analysis are de- fined by the data available and the scope of the questions I chose to investigate. Although no definite answer can be given to what "actually" happened, my inten- tion is to offer a possible, reasonable interpretation that takes into account par- ticipants' habituses (as afforded by the data available) and to lay the groundwork for a meaningful discussion of equity in mathematics classrooms. Rather than draw definitive conclusions from the data, I raise important questions to consider, particularly questions that have an impact on instructional practices. The intent of this analysis is to offer an interpretation of the 6-minute video segment that might be useful and relevant to other classroom situations, with the goal of moving us toward more equitable mathematics education. DATA The discussion in the 6-minute video segment analyzed is a continuation of an earlier discussion by a third-grade classroom on the nature of odd and evenp. 137 138 Equity in a Mathematics Classroom: An Exploration numbers on January 19, 1990. For a social practice theorist, the 6-minute segment lacks sufficient context to adequately analyze interactions with respect to equity. In addition to the 6-minute segment, however, I was able to view supplemen- tal data sources, including three preceding mathematics lessons of this particular classroom (in which even and odd were discussed), the remainder of the lesson from which the 6-minute segment was extracted, journal entries of students and teacher (which include reflections on this particular lesson), and demographic in- formation about the students. Although the 6-minute segment and supplemental data sources provided a win- dow into this classroom, I note that the video was recorded by an unknown person, under unknown conditions. Collecting data is always a subjective and selective activity (Goodwin, 1994; Hall, 2000). We highlight, include, and exclude accord- ing to our own perspectives and preferences. Those omissions and inclusions can lead to distortion and misinterpretation. This statement is true for any act of per- ceiving or recording data, including our own interpretive acts when we analyze those data. An important consideration when addressing equity issues in the classroom is to explore how the demographics of the students and teacher might affect mathe- matical conversations (e.g., power dynamics, turns of talk, cultural preferences). Fortunately, those data were available. The demographics are shown in Appendix 2 to this monograph. As we can see in Appendix 2, this classroom contained 9 white and 10 black students, 9 male and 10 female students; 13 of the 19 students were proficient in the English language. ANALYSIS Classroom Culture The mathematical pedagogy used in this classroom was intended to reflect prac- tices of the mathematics community, as viewed by Lakatos (1976). The teacher describes this pedagogy as "based on a fallibilist epistemology" (Ball, 1988, p. 5). It adopts a "particular perspective on the nature of mathematical knowledge and activity" and "views the mathematical practice as a discourse community concerned with common questions and engaged collaboratively in pursuing and assessing mathematical ideas and in which more than traditional proof counts" (Ball, 1991, p. 46). In this classroom, as in any classroom, were expectations that participants would behave and communicate in certain ways. As in the classroom depicted in Proofs and Refutations (Lakatos, 1976; see, e.g., pp. 76-77), claims, defini- tions, conjectures, and statements were attributed to individuals, and students and teacher referred to "Sheena's definition," "Mei's conjecture," and "Sean numbers." Students routinely made conjectures and claims, justified their positions, generated examples and counterexamples, transformed claims, and used the mathematicalp. 138 Tamar Posner 139 register. Teacher and students used a particular register, speaking of "conjectures," "proving," and "definitions." Students and teacher used the words agree and disagree in reference to both people and ideas (see Table 4.1; see also Table 4.4 in this article's Appendix).

Sheena offered a definition, and Mei revised it. It became the "working definition" for even numbers (see Figure 4.2). Because the third graders could not come to a consensus about the evenness or oddness of zero, the teacher suggested that they organize a meeting on January 18 with the fourth graders to further dis- cuss the matter. In that meeting, participants contemplated whether zero is even, odd, even and odd, or just a special number. I would say the definition for an even number is, is two equal, two of the same numbers on each side without halfs. Well, an odd number is something that has one number left over... After you circle the two's. Figure 4.2. Definitions for even and odd in student journal entries and utterances.p. 139 140 Equity in a Mathematics Classroom: An Exploration During the January 19 lesson, the teacher repeatedly asked students to reflect on past lessons, particularly on the previous day's meeting with the fourth-grade class. During the January 19 class, "Ofala's definition" for odd number (see Figure 4.2) became another working definition. The nature of even numbers was discussed on January 19. In particular the class discussed whether zero is even or odd. Several meanings of even were discussed, including definitions based on (a) the number line, (b) "two equal things make it," and (c) groupings of twos. Each of those meanings was associated with a particular kind of representation (see Figures 4.2 and 4.3). Distinctions related to meaning, definition, and property were not discussed. A summary of the sequence of lessons, and of the class's working definitions, is shown in Table 4.2. Analysis of the 6 Minutes on January 19 With this "history" as a backdrop, I next proceed with a detailed examination of two segments within the 6 minutes. First segment: Is zero odd or even? In the 6-minute segment, the teacher started the lesson by stating her agenda to solicit students' experiences from the previous day's discussion with the fourth graders. One of the students, Sheena, made the first attempt to answer the teacher's "Two equal things make it," "Groups of twos" Number line Figure 4.3.

Sean argues that one is even throughout the lesson. Other students disagree. Lucy offers a definition of even based on the number line. Lucy offers a conjecture: if a number ends with an odd, it is odd; with an even, it is even. Betsy says that on the basis of the number line, zero has to be odd. Sean: zero is not a number, extended argument with him. Teacher asks students to stop arguing with Sean. Zero is even, argument based on the number line. The nature of even and odd numbers is discussed at length. Discussion of whether zero is nothing or a number. Discussion of the "use" of odd and even num- bers.

Discussion of what Sean means, contributions from several students. After the lesson, the teacher writes in her log about "Sean's discovery." Note.

Sheena described how the previous day's discussion with the fourth grad- ers had helped her better understand the nature of zero. The teacher then asked her to give a particular example of how she revised her understanding, and the following exchange occurred: Transcript commentary 6' Sheena: Well, I didn't think that zero was-zero, um--even or odd until yesterday. They said that it could be even because of the ones on each side is odd, so that couldn't be odd. So that helped me understand it. 7 Teacher: Hmm. So y- So you thought about something that came up in the meeting that you hadn't thought about before? Okay. Evidence that Sheena appears to under- stand odd and even as mutually exclusive. She refers the alternation of even and odd on the number line. 8 Sheena: (nods) 9 Teacher: Other people's comments? Sean? Sheena tells the teacher how what other people ("they") said in the previous day's meeting helped her understand how zero "could be even" and "couldn't be odd" on the number line (6)1. Then the teacher reiterated what Sheena said about how the previous day's discussion influenced her thinking. They both appear sat- isfied with this exchange (7, 8). Then the teacher solicited additional comments from other students (9). Instead of providing the teacher with comments regarding his own experi- ence, Sean continued to discuss Sheena's ideas, and engaged her in the following disagreement: Transcript commentary 10 Sean: Um, I-I- I just want to say something to Sheena, when sh- what she said about um that, that one, um-zero has to be an odd, an even number bec- I disagree because, um, because what what two things can you put together to make it? 11 Sheena: Could you repeat what you said, please? 13 Sean: Okay, um, I disagree with you because, um, if it was an even number, how- what two things could make it? 14 Sheena: Well, I could show you it. [Moves toward the chalkboard and points to the number line above the chalkboard.] Um, I forgot what his name was-but yesterday he said that this one [points to the 1 on the number line] and each-this one is odd and this one [points to the-1 on the num- ber line] is odd, so this one has to be even. 1 The number indicates line number of the transcript. Sean changes the teacher's agenda. He refers to the "two things make it" definition. Note that Sean dis- agrees with "you" rather than "your idea." Again, Sheena appears to understand odd and even as mutually exclusive.p. 142 Tamar Posner 143 15 Sean: But, that doesn't mean it always is even. Does Sean think that even is a changeable property? 16 Sheena: It could be even. Sheena softens her claim from "has to" to "could." 17 Sean: It could be, but... 18 Sheena: I'm not saying that is has to be even. I meant Sheena maintains the that it could be. change from "has to" to "could." 19 Sean: You said it was. Through this exchange, Sheena seemed to change her position a number of times. In the beginning, she stated that zero could be even and couldn't be odd (6). After a short exchange with Sean, she concluded that "zero has to be even" (14). Yet few turns later, she stated that what she meant was that "it [zero] could be [even]." Using the multiple lenses of social practice theory, science studies, and socio- linguistics, we ask, Did Sheena change her understanding about the nature of zero through the work of the disagreement? Was she convinced by Sean's argument? Did she understand the difference between claims for necessity and claims for possibility? Was she confused? Or simply holding a space for what others had previously said? Both Sheena and Sean provided justifications for their positions. Although Sheena's position seemed to have changed, the justifications she gave for both po- sitions were similar. Both heavily depended on alternating patterns on the number line. In contrast, Sean's justification, which was given in the form of a question (10, 13), suggests that he used a different definition of even numbers, in which even numbers are made out of two things. (We have yet to determine what the "things" are.) Did Sean and Sheena use different representations differently to think about even numbers and, as a result, misunderstand each other? Was rep- resentation the core of their disagreement? Was their disagreement conceptually based or interpersonal or both? Sheena justified her position(s) on the basis of what a third party had argued the previous day. This third party was not present in the classroom during this discus- sion. That party at first was referred to by Sheena as a general "they" and at a later utterance became more specifically "Um, I forgot what his name was-but yes- terday he said" (14). Bringing an explanation in the name of somebody else can be interpreted in multiple ways, from using the other one as an ally to strengthen a claim (Latour, 1987) to a strategy for avoiding personal responsibility in the event that the claim turns out to be "wrong" (Ong, 2002), to the documentation of a historical event. At this point, the reason Sheena brought in the fourth grader as the principal originator of her claim is unclear.p. 143 144 Equity in a Mathematics Classroom: An Exploration After performing two self-repairs, Sean reiterated Sheena's position inaccu- rately, stating that she had said zero has to be even whereas she said zero could be even (6). What was Sean disagreeing with? Was he disagreeing with what Sheena actually said (e.g., zero could be even and cannot be odd)? Or was he disagree- ing with what he said she said (e.g., zero has to be even)? Sheena may have been wondering about those same questions as she asked Sean to repeat himself (11). A clear mark of disagreement was drawn by Sean's opening statement (10), which were repeated in his subsequent turn (13). Sean was clear and up-front about his disagreeing status, and repeatedly marked himself as the disagreeing party (10, 13). As Engle and Greeno's re- search suggests, perhaps for Sean the disagreement was primarily a "conceptual based" one about the nature of zero rather than an "interpersonal" one. However, as the conversation continued, his motivations for disagreeing with Sheena were unclear and might have changed. After the short exchange between Sean and Sheena, Sean challenged Sheena and argued that her explanation did not "mean it [zero] always is [even]" (15). Sheena did not object and replied that "it could be," to which Sean seemed to agree that "it could be but ..." (17). At this point, one could expect the disagreement to dissolve, because the engaging parties had reached an agreement that zero could be even. Yet Sean continued, "but ..." (17), to which Sheena quickly replied, "I'm not saying that is has to be even. I meant that it could" (18). Her intonation suggested that she expected to end this exchange having stated her agreement with Sean (e.g., zero could be even). Moreover, in addition to clarifying her current position, "I'm not saying that it has to be even," in accordance with the classroom practices, she emphasized her meaning, insinuating that even in the past (if she had said differently) she "meant it [zero] could be [even]" (17). He replied quickly, "You said it was" (18). At this point one wonders if the issue at stake for Sean was not whether zero had to be or could be even (which they seemed to agree about); rather it was whether Sheena was right or wrong. To better understand the meanings Sheena and Sean made out of this exchange, I returned to the previous lessons in which I searched for visible patterns of Sheena's and Sean's behavior as well as their contributions leading to the current discussion. With these brief "histories" at hand, we are better situated to consider the previous questions: Did Sheena change her understanding about the nature of zero? Was she con- vinced by Sean's argument? Did she understand the difference between claims for necessity and claims for possibility? Was she confused? Lessons of January 16, 17, 18, and 19: Sheena Sheena is an African American girl. She is a native English speaker and is a relatively new member in this classroom (three months, see Table 4.1). On several occasions in the previous lessons, she attributed the justification of her positions to third parties (mainly boys) who were not present during her talk.p. 144 Tamar Posner 145 Sheena seemed to have a clear grasp of the nature of even and odd numbers. In a previous lesson she provided a verbal definition of an even number: "I'd say that the definition for an even number is um, a number that you can split." She gave six as an example, "Say you have six, so I'll make this ... and then you want to have it so you can split it in half and so you split what you have, the same amount of numbers on each side." She made a drawing on the chalkboard (see Figure 4.4). Figure 4.4. Sheena's representation for six. She defined even numbers as numbers that are "made out of two things" (other numbers). Later, her classmate, Mei, revised Sheena's definition. But, I, I don't think they ... yeah, but I still don't think that you could, that you could do it. Well I think what Sheena, I think Sheena should revise to that, even numbers that have the, numbers that you can split that have the same amount on each side without having to have halves. This definition was discussed at length and referred to as "Sheena's definition" nine times in the three previous lessons. Sheena often used tentative, uncommitted language (e.g., could, might). She did not occupy the public floor often. During the January 17 and 19 lesson, she had 13 and 14 turns (see Table 4.3), and when she did, her turns were mainly allocated to her by the teacher. Lessons of January 16, 17, 18, and 19: Sean Sean is a Caucasian boy. He is a native English speaker and was one of the "old timers" in the classroom (two years). Sean was an active participant in class- room discussions and frequently occupied the classroom floor (see Table 4.4). He seemed to be a dissenter; when asked by the teacher later in the January 19 lesson if he was comfortable in that position, he replied that he was. Teacher: What about you, Sean? A couple of times this week, you've had, you've taken a position that nobody else in the class agreed with. What does that make, does that make you change your mind, how does that make you feel? Sean: It makes me feel fine. He was the initiator of many disagreements and frequently used the word dis- agree to mark his position (see Table 4.4). At one point in the January 17 lesson, the teacher explicitly asked students not to further argue with Sean (see Table 4.3 for further details). On other occasions, some students explicitly refrained from arguing with him. Sean repeatedly used self-repairs, pauses, and unfinished sentences in his talk. As a consequence, other classroom participants (mostly the teacher) often reiterated his utterances in an attempt to clarify his intent. These reiterations usually included sensible interpretations, which seemed distinctly dif-p. 145 146 Equity in a Mathematics Classroom: An Exploration ferent from his original sentences. They were often posed in the form of questions that were longer and more detailed than Sean's original utterances. Sean seldom credited definitions, claims, or ideas to other participants. To some extent Sean appeared to grasp the classroom's definition of even numbers (as one can see from the way he couched his initial question to Sheena). However, his understanding of this concept seemed unstable, in that he frequently made errors in his attempt to classify numbers as even or odd. For example, he argued that 30 is odd because Table 4.3.

The January 17 statistics are compiled from a transcript provided by Ball. In that transcript 104 turns were attributed to "student" or had no attribution. The content of many of the turns attributed to "student" suggests that they may have been Sean's. Statistics from the January 16 and 18 transcripts are not included in this table because many turns of talk are not attributed to particular students.p. 146 Tamar Posner 147 3 is odd (Teacher's log, 1990). Later in the January 19 class, he said that an odd number was one that could be split into an odd number of groups (415), probably meaning an odd number of groups of two. On a few occasions, to justify his posi- tion, he turned to "personal" justifications, such as, "One is even because my mom said so... ." He believed her "because I trust her." Sean often had a disproportionately large number of turns to talk compared with the other students in the classroom (see Table 4.3). For example, the lesson from which the analyzed segment is taken comprised a total of 521 turns of talk. The teacher had 208 turns, and Sean had 114 turns. The next most frequent stu- dent speaker was Ofala, with 28 turns of talk. The extensive floor time Sean had in the classroom is also reflected in this chapter (i.e., I was able to provide more history for Sean than Sheena because of more available data). Turns were both given to him by the teacher and initiated by him. When competing for floor time with other students, he was often the winner. When he got the floor, on several occasions he did not answer the question the teacher asked the class. Rather he had "something else" to say and changed the teacher's agenda. (For example, see lines 9-10 and lines 59-60.) 59 Teacher. More comments about the meeting? (Mei whispers: Oh I have. Her voice rises at the end. She raises her hand.) I'd really like to hear from as many people as possible what comments you had or reactions you had to being in that meeting yesterday. Sean? 60 Sean: (Sean is off camera, Mei's hand is still up.) Um, I don't have anything about the meeting yesterday, but I was just thinking about six, that it's a.... I'm just thinking. I'm just thinking it can be an odd number, too, 'cause there could be two, four, six, and two, three twos, that'd make six ... Returning to the analysis of January 19 Sheena's utterances within the context of the previous lessons suggest that her understanding of even numbers was stable. Moreover, she was one of the "origi- nators" of what was called in class the working definition of even numbers (see Table 4.3). In addition, she had offered a visual representation of this definition on the classroom chalkboard. Thus one might reasonably assume that Sheena was well versed in the "two things make it" definition of even numbers and was com- fortable and familiar with its visual representation. Yet rather than join Sean in the representation he used-a representation that she was familiar with-as he challenged her position, she chose the number line to illustrate the explanation for her position that zero is an even number. Even though this choice warrants an explanation, the available data do not allow us to resolve this issue. Not all representations are created equal. Sheena chose for her justification to show the pattern on the number line. The number line was a permanent participant in the classroom (Latour, 1987). In fact, it had quite an honorable and visible posi- tion in front of the classroom above the chalkboard; this position suggested it wasp. 147 148 Equity in a Mathematics Classroom: An Exploration endorsed by classroom authority (e.g., the teacher). In comparison, "two things make it" was of a different status. Its visual representation was a temporary par- ticipant in the classroom, and it often disappeared as the chalkboard was erased. In addition, it was introduced by a female minority student, Sheena, to support a definition of even number she proposed. Thus it may not have had the authoritative power of the durable number line. Not surprisingly, Sheena chose the number line (a durable representation) over the flimsiness of the "two things make it" represen- tation as an ally in her argument with Sean. The number line's authoritative stance might explain her persistence in using it, and the fact that she refused to join Sean in his use of an alternative definition even though she appeared to understand that definition well. Sean, in contrast, kept on using the "two things make it" definition from the previous classroom discussions. Ironically, Sean used Sheena's definition to make his point, whereas she relied on the authoritative number line. As Hall (1999) reminds us, the challenge of analyzing a conversation is that to some degree we are entering in the middle. That challenge was certainly confront- ed in this analysis, because the classroom had a history that includes discussion of the same topics as those discussed in the analyzed segment. On the one hand, Sean may have been referring to the class's working definition of even numbers, and perhaps was holding Sheena accountable to this definition, which she had intro- duced and which had been named after her. On the other hand, given his "history," we might reasonably suspect that for Sean, alternating between definitions and representations was difficult; he appeared confused about the meaning of even. Confusion may have been the reason he kept on referring to the "two things make it" definition and refused to accept Sheena's explanation based on the number line. Only toward the end of the exchange did he shift from challenging her position that zero could be even to challenging what she actually said. Still other matters remain to be explained. If Sheena was solid in her under- standing of the nature of even numbers, why did she change her mind through the short duration of this exchange, from saying that "zero could be even" to saying that "zero has to be even" and back to saying she meant to say that "zero could be even"? In the analyzed segment, Sheena twice voiced her position in the name of a third party that was not present at the time of the discussion (e.g., "they said," "he said"). This tactic, combined with her use of tentative language (a common style preference among females, as discussed in the "Theoretical Framework" section) might indicate that Sheena, to some degree, did not want to be held responsible for her position. Sheena appeared reluctant to take verbal authorship of her position. Yet when Sean repeated his challenge to her, she used more forceful language, which was compatible with her explanation. However, as the disagreement continued, Sheena backed off. In an attempt to dissolve the disagreement, she returned to the use of noncommittal language, saying, "I meant it could be even," to which Sean quickly replied, "but you said it was," ending the disagreement with a possible confronta- tion--eventually showing she was "wrong" At the point in which Sheena backedp. 148 Tamar Posner 149 off, she chose to actively disengage from this disagreement, and in some ways she contributed to her own invisibility. Second Segment Whereas the first segment showed the interwoven nature of conceptually based and interpersonal disagreements, the second segment illustrates possible uses of everyday and mathematical meanings for even in the same utterances. In this analysis, I use even with its common mathematical meaning, that is, an integer is even if it can be written as 2n for some integer n. After the first segment, the teacher revisited her agenda and asked the students, once again, for their comments about the previous day's meeting with the fourth graders. Nathan, in response to her request, shared his experience. Nathan (in ac- cordance with classroom practice) stated that as a result of the meeting, he revised his idea from thinking that zero was even to thinking that zero was special. To justify his position that zero is a special number and not an even number, Nathan strove to "make up" the set of even numbers in such a way that zero was not, and could not be, part of the made up set, thereby to prove his point that zero was a special number. In the following transcript, I indicate two constructions that Nathan appeared to make to construct the even numbers. Nathan responded to the teacher's request with the following statement: Transcript commentary 25 Um:::, first I said that um (.) zero wa::s e::ven but then I guess I revised so that zero, I think, is special because um, I, um, ::: marks indicates lengthened syllable; each : equals one beat. even numbers? Like they they make even numbers; like two, um, two makes four, and four is an even number and four makes eight eight is an even number and u::m, like that. Intonation drops. CONSTRUCTIONATrEMPT 1 Drop in intonation suggests that Nathan has completed his first attempt to con- struct the even numbers. And, and go on like that. and like one plus one and go CONSTRUCTIONATTEMPT 2 on adding the same numbers with the same numbers. And so I, I think zero's special. I started with the assumption that Nathan's argument made sense (McDermott, 1993). Nathan repeatedly used the terms make, made, and go on, which are terms that often indicate a mode of construction (Walkerdine, 1988). Attempt 1 has two possible interpretations. One is that Nathan was trying to construct the evenlyp. 149 150 Equity in a Mathematics Classroom: An Exploration evens, the even numbers greater than 2, that is, 4, 8, 12, 16, ... , using 2 + 2, 4 + 4, 6 + 6, and so on. A second interpretation is that Nathan was trying to con- struct numbers by doubling, beginning with 2, and resulting in 4, 8, 16, 32, ... ,us- ing 2 + 2, 4 + 4, 8 + 8, and so on. Whichever of these constructions was intended, he still had a problem, assuming that he was trying to construct the set of all even numbers. Neither of his constructed sets included all the even numbers he needed to justify his position that zero was special. His constructed sets still had many "missing evens." After Nathan's first attempt to construct the even numbers, his intonation drops as he utters, "like that," indicating an ending of a train of thought or a conversation. Given that Attempt 1 did not result in the desired set, his mak- ing Attempt 2 is not surprising. This time he took the same numbers and added them to make "another" even number. He says, "and like one plus one and go on adding the same numbers with the same numbers." This method of constructing the set of even numbers is consistent with the class- room's working definition of even numbers as numbers made by two equal things. This method expanded Nathan's initial set so that all positive even numbers (exclud- ing zero) were accounted for. Hence, as far as he was concerned, he had offered a reasonable justification of his position that zero was special, and his turn was over. However, for the teacher it was not the end. She needed some clarification. After promising the class to return to her agenda (comments on yesterday's meeting), she asked Nathan, "Were you saying that when you put even numbers together, you get another even number?" (26). She may be asking whether Nathan means that the sum of two even numbers is even. He gives a short reply, "Yeah" (27). The teacher continued to question Nathan about his intentions, asking, "Or were you saying that all even numbers are made up of even numbers?" (28) After a short hesitation, he replies once again, "Yeah, they are'"2 (29). The mathematical meaning of the word or is inclusive, but its everyday mean- ing is exclusive. The teacher's use of or at the beginning of her second question to Nathan might have indicated (to Nathan and the rest of the class) some problem in compatibility between the two choices. However, Nathan still answered with a positive gesture, implying that for him both options were viable-meaning both statements were correct: "When you put even numbers together you get an even number" and "All even numbers are made up of other even numbers." To help make sense of this dialogue, what follows is some of Nathan's "history." Lessons of January 16, 17, 18, and 19: Nathan Nathan is an Ethiopian boy. He is a fluent English speaker and was one of the "old timers" in the school-three years (see Table 4.1). As seen in Table 4.2, 2 This transcription differs from the other used in this monograph. Readers may wish to watch the accompanying video and decide for themselves.p. 150 Tamar Posner 151 Nathan said little during the lesson. His lack of participation had also been evident in the previous three lessons, in which he had a total of five turns. The teacher commented in her journal that he did homework incorrectly owing to what she thought might be a misinterpretation of the task. For Nathan the word even had multiple significations. He often used even to mean "equal" and "same." At other times he used even with its usual mathematical meaning. Returning to analysis of January 19 In this dialogue Nathan and the teacher may have been using the term even dif- ferently. Even has multiple meanings, depending on the context in which it is used (Walkerdine, 1988). It could be used in multiple ways across participants, across utterances of the same participant, or even within an utterance (Goodwin, 1994; Walkerdine, 1988). The word even has been used in this particular classroom in different contexts. Often even meant a number that is in the set of even numbers. On other occasions, even was used as part of "everyday language" and meant "equal" or "the same." Thus in the context of this particular classroom, the utter- ance "made out of two even numbers" could have different meanings: (1) numbers that belong to the set of even numbers, such as four and six; or (2) two equal numbers, such as three and three. It is possible that for Nathan, the two alterna- tives presented by the teacher posed no problem, since "when you put two even numbers together, you get an even number" and "all even numbers are made out of even [equal, same] numbers." For Nathan, perhaps both statements made sense with the classroom's working definition. The teacher continued to question Nathan's meaning. She revoiced his utter- ances, this time including both statements, combining them with but, once again indicating the existence of some contradictions. In the transcript that follows, I annotate instances in which different meanings of even allow different interpreta- tions of utterances. Transcript commentary 34 Teacher Nathan said a minute ago that when Teacher revoices what Nathan you put even numbers together you said. Possible ambiguity: "Sums get an even number, of equal numbers are even" or "sums of even numbers are even. 35 Betsy Mm-hm. 36 Teacher But he also said, I think? (.) that all Possible ambiguity: 'All even even numbers are made up of other numbers are made out of even even numbers numbers" or (.) indicates very slight pause. 'All even numbers are made out of equal numbers" As they continued (in lines 37-43), both the teacher and Nathan used the same words, even, same, and equal. However, those words may have had differentp. 151 152 Equity in a Mathematics Classroom: An Exploration meanings for both participants at different parts of the conversation. On the one hand, the teacher used even to refer only to numbers belonging to the set of even numbers. For Nathan, on the other hand, the word even had multiple significations. He often used even to mean "equal" and "same," and at other times used even to include numbers belonging to the set of even numbers. The teacher, in her attempt to clarify Nathan's utterances (34), made the distinc- tion of the evenly even: "when you put even numbers together you get an even number." Betsy (35) seems to agree with that statement. In the next part of the discussion, the teacher says that she thinks Nathan also said that all even numbers are made out of even numbers. Transcript commentary 37 Mei: I disagree. (raises her hand) (says something to Mei) Two even numbers just the same. Yeah, like four. Like eight is four plus four? Are all the even numbers- can you do that with all the even numbers? That they'd be made up of two identical even numbers? Mei may be disagreeing with "all even numbers are made out of even numbers." Ambiguous: "two equal numbers that are just the same" or "two even numbers that are just the same." It is not clear what Nathan is agreeing with. The teacher is not sure what Nathan is agreeing with and attempts to clarify. Possible ambiguity (as lines 34a, 34c): The same equal numbers (e.g., three and three) or the same even numbers (e.g., four andfour). Nathan agrees. Possible ambiguity: Are they made up of two identical equal numbers (creating the full set of even numbers) or two identical even numbers (creating a subset of the even numbers, the evenly even numbers3) In lines 45-58, Nathan and Betsy talk further with each other; Betsy tries to make sense of Nathan's statements, and seems to realize that Nathan is talking about a subset of the even numbers (the evenly even numbers). Mei and Sean interject comments (indicated in gray in the transcript that follows). Betsy and Nathan face each other, appearing not to attend to Mei's and Sean's comments, but rather to be engaged in their own conversation. 3 The set of evenly even numbers is obtained by successive doubling: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and so on. This set is discussed in more detail at the end of this section. 38 Sheena: 39 Teacher: 40 Nathan: Unh-uh.

To which Nathan agrees but has something more to say. Sean does not appear to be part of the conversation between Betsy and Nathan.

Nathan agrees with Betsy and em- phasizes that he is talking only about a subset of the even numbers. Okay. Finishing his statement in line 61 and indicating that he is not including all the even numbers: like 2, 4, 6, 8. Instead he is talking about a subset, even numbers that are sums of the same. After this exchange, the teacher returned to her agenda, asking for more com- ments about the meeting. Transcript commentary 59 Teacher: (4) More comments about the meet- ing?

Transcript commentary Sean changes the teacher's agenda from discussion ofyesterday's meet- ing to discussion of six being an odd number Sean states that he is thinking of the number six (not a set of numbers in contrast with the set discussed by Nathan and Betsy) and that six is made of two threes and three twos. His "two, four, six" is similar to Nathan's "two, four, six" in line 61. As Sean and other students (e.g., Betsy) noticed before, six can be made of two odd numbers. However, unlike the other students he insists that six is both odd and even. Sean is still talking about the num- ber six (not a set of numbers). The teacher asks Sean if the "two things" are odd. The teacher asks Sean again if the "two things" are odd. 64 Sean Uh huh, and the thing, the OTHER, those two/the TWOS (.) we::re (.) even. Sean argued that six could be odd and even. His justification echoed Betsy's ob- servation about six (48, 50): Six is made of three twos and three is odd. However, Betsy did not conclude from her observation that six is odd.p. 155 156 Equity in a Mathematics Classroom: An Exploration In lines 65-67, the teacher connects Sean's and Nathan's comments. Transcript commentary 65 Teacher So you're kind of/ I think Nathan said then that he wasn't talking about every even number, right, Nathan? 66 Nathan Yeah, I/I'm not] (Pen in mouth.) 67 Teacher //Were you] saying that? Some of the even numbers (.) like six are made up of two odds, like you just suggested. The teacher connects Sean's argument that the number six is odd because it's made of three groups of two with Nathan's comment about a set (the evenly evens). Her comment suggests that she was aware of Nathan's idea about a subset of even numbers that doesn't include all even numbers. Nathan confirms that he was not talking about all even numbers, but rather a proper (i.e. doesn't contain all even numbers) subset of the even numbers. The teacher appears to be talking to Sean. She revoices his statement about six being odd because it is made up of two threes as a more general statement that "some of the even num- bers like six are made up of two odds." The teacher started by talking to Sean. In line 65, she connected Sean's com- ment about a single number with Nathan's construction of a set of numbers by referring to what Nathan said. Then, in line 67, she implied that Sean's suggestion that "six is odd because it's made of two threes" is an example of a more general phenomenon, the oddly evens. Later in the January 19 lesson Later in the lesson, the idea of six being odd and even was discussed further. Several times during the lesson students responded to Sean's talk about six by saying that if a number could be decomposed into an odd number of groups of two, that it was not necessarily odd and even itself. For example, Keith said, "That doesn't necessarily mean that six is odd" (75), and explained further, "Because, just because two odd numbers add up to an even number doesn't mean it has to be odd" (78). Later, Riba also disagreed with Sean (315) and said, "I'm going to show ... see, it doesn't ... um, it doesn't matter how much circles there are, it matters when you like put one, two, three, four, five, six.., it doesn't matter about, it doesn't mean.., how much times you circle two, it doesn't prove that six is an odd number" (317). Mei tried to express what she thought Sean was saying, "I think what he is say- ing is that it's almost, see, I think what he's saying is that you have three groups of two. And three is an odd number so six can be an odd number and a even number" (145). After the teacher asked her if she agreed with that (six being odd and even), Mei said that she disagreed (149) and gave an example (153),p. 156 Tamar Posner 157 Let's say that I have [pauses]. Let's see. If you call six an odd number, why don't [pause] let's see [pause] let's say ten. One, two.... [draws circles on board] and here are ten circles. And then you would split them, let's say I wanted to split, spit them, split them by twos... One, two, . ... , one, two, three, four, five... [she draws] Sean thanked Mei, then said, "so-I say it's-ten can be an odd and an even" (158). Later, Ofala gave another example, "Well, I just think, urn, that just because you put twenty-two there and that makes eleven, that that doesn't mean that it's an odd number. My conjecture, I think it's always true, because if all twos are circled in a number that's even, then it's an even number" (431). SUMMARY OF IDEAS, WORDS, AND REPRESENTATIONS USED IN THE DISCUSSION Figure 4.5 provides a summary of pivotal elements in the conversation. The first two rows show Sheena's definition of January 17 as revised by Mei, and the remaining rows refer to the January 19 lesson. The first column tracks the use of the number line and such related ideas as skipping and patterns of numbers. At the beginning of the lesson Sheena used the number line to illustrate her idea about zero being even. Much later in the lesson Riba used the number line to describe the pattern that she saw. The second column of Figure 4.5 tracks the use of the "two things make it" definition and its associated representation. The third column tracks the use of grouping by twos and its associated representation. The fourth column tracks participants' word use. At the beginning of the lesson, Sheena used the phrases has to be, which she subsequently softened to could be. Later, students talked about "can be odd" and "can be odd and even." Throughout the lesson, even, same, and equal were used interchangeably. Note that the representation is used to discuss sets of numbers and patterns of numbers, but the representations associated with "two things make it" and "groups of two" are not. Discussion of the characteristics of odd and even numbers can be traced to at least 500 AD. In book I of his De arithmetica, Boethius identified three subsets of the even numbers, the "evenly-odd," "evenly-even," and "oddly-even" (Swetz, 1995). Two of these subsets (evenly odd and evenly even) emerged in this class- room discussion. When an evenly even number is divided into two equal parts, the parts are al- ways evenly even and can again be separated into two evenly even parts, until the process ends with one. Such numbers are obtained by successive doubling: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and so on. Nathan's remarks appear to be an attempt toward constructing this set. Evenly odd numbers are those that can be divided into equal parts, but the halves cannot again be separated into equal parts. Examples are 2, 6, 10, 18, 22.p. 157 "Two things make it" "Groups of two" "Could be," "can be," "has to be" "Same," "equal," "even" Skipping, patterns 5 4 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 Sheena Jan. 17 Mei Jan. 17 Sheena Pattern of odd and even on the 14 number line Sheena 16,18 Nathan 25 Teacher 28 Two things make it . . . without using halves Zero has to be even.

[159] 160 Equity in a Mathematics Classroom: An Exploration Evenly odd numbers are generated by multiplying odd numbers by two, and the successive numbers in the evenly odd sequence differ by four. Sean's remarks were revoiced by the teacher (e.g., lines 67, 341), Mei, and later Riba (see Figure 4.5) in ways that moved the class closer to constructing this set. DISCUSSION In the segments analyzed, we see two discussions that were cultivated by the teacher to publicly explore a mathematical concept in the classroom. Although both were about the understanding of odd and even numbers, they had some es- sential differences. This section is organized around three main issues illuminated through my analysis: (1) the shift from conceptually based to interpersonal dis- agreements, (2) the use of everyday and mathematics registers in the classroom, and (3) the practice of assigning competence and attributing "discoveries" to in- dividuals. I remind the reader that the data available permit me to illustrate how equity considerations can be seen through an analysis of daily interactions in a classroom, but that this analysis can only raise questions about what happened in this particular classroom. Shift from Conceptual to Personal Disagreements The first segment showed how content-based talk can morph into interpersonal talk. This shift can have an important effect on the goals of students and teacher. When such a shift occurs, we see that participants either retreat from the conversa- tion or preserve some posture that does not necessarily have much to do with the content at hand. How might such shifts be affected by habitus? Previous studies indicate that gender and race tend to affect student participation (e.g., girls retreat from confrontation, nonnative speakers are more reluctant to speak out, etc.). When Sheena and Sean's conversation shifted from conceptual to personal (e.g., you said this, I said that), Sheena withdrew from the conversation and barely par- ticipated thereafter. Although we do not have enough information to understand why she withdrew, Sheena's withdrawal raises an issue that teachers deal with daily in classrooms. Without teacher intervention, classroom participants might also implicitly or explicitly use those backgrounds as tools to position themselves in the classroom. This dynamic might contribute to problems with equity within the mathematics classroom. Such shifts could become fertile moments for teacher intervention, were a teacher to redirect the conversation back to the content. Looking at such mo- ments can be a way for teachers to see how close examination of talk-and at- tending to such shifts-can inform them in refining their classroom practice. In the given segment (and the overall lesson), on a number of occasions students and teacher expressed their disagreements by naming people rather than the idea itself (e.g., "I disagree with Sheena" rather than "I disagree with Sheena's defi-p. 160 Tamar Posner 161 nition"; see Table 4.5 in this chapter's Appendix). This kind of naming might also contribute to some students' shying away from expressing their ideas (Ong, 2002) and to some students' challenging the ideas of others. In such instances, teachers have an opportunity to redirect the conversation by framing a student's idea as a concept (e.g., "So you disagree that zero is odd?") rather than attribute it solely to an individual. If we can find ways to locate those moments of shift in talk as they happen, then intervention can be fruitful. Through our intervening and keeping the conversa- tion focused on concepts, classrooms might become safer spaces for students who traditionally do not speak out in discussions. Thus, identifying and intervening in such moments can become a practical way to address equity. Further investigation is warranted in understanding and sharing best intervention practices. Use of Everyday and Mathematical Registers In this classroom, even had multiple meanings, including "equal," "made of the same two things," and "member of the set of even numbers." My analysis suggests that the different meanings for even in this classroom contributed to dif- ficulties in communication among the participants and possibly led to confusion about the nature of "even" numbers. Whereas mathematicians are more fluent and consistent in the use of mathematical language, young students typically use everyday and mathematical registers interchangeably, a tendency that can lead to misunderstandings based on their comprehension of terms used in everyday life. In fact, they sometimes use a mathematical term with different meanings in the same sentence (Schegloff, 1992). We need to be sensitive while engaging in mathematical conversations with stu- dents, especially those who are not fluent English speakers. Possibly, for example, Nathan was misunderstood because of the way he used the word even. Teachers need to know that "everyday" and "mathematical" registers can be the basis of miscommunication; probing further to clarify terms can be helpful in fostering understanding. Attribution One of the practices used by this classroom teacher has been called (by the teacher herself) "assigning competence" (Ball, Goffney, & Bass, 2005, p. 4; Boaler, 2003). This practice involves teachers' raising the status of students that may or may not be of a lower status in a group. To do so, for example, the teacher might praise something a student has said or done that has intellectual value, and bring it to the group's attention; ask a student to present an idea; or publicly praise a student's work in a whole-class setting. One way in which teachers do so is by revoicing students' ideas in their own words. O'Connor and Michael (1996) note that "revoicing" is a powerful strategy teach- ers use to facilitate discussions and scaffold student understandings. It is also a means by which teachers give validation and credit for ideas to students who mayp. 161 162 Equity in a Mathematics Classroom: An Exploration not have been recognized by their classmates. By aligning students with particular ideas, revoicing can also position students as thinkers and hypothesizers. I would argue that the subtle difference between revoicing and inventing a student idea can also be unclear and open to interpretation. In this example, from the comment "six is even and odd," the class moved to the classification of numbers as "oddly even" through a series of revoicings and translations (see e.g., transcript lines 67, 145, 334, 341,9417). After the lesson, the teacher wrote in her journal (Ball, 1993, p. 387), I'm wondering if I should introduce to the class the idea that Sean has identified (discovered) a new category of numbers-those that have the property he has noted. We could name them after him. Or maybe this is silly-will just confuse them since its nonstandard knowledge-i.e., not part of the wider mathematical community's shared knowledge. I have to think about this. It has the potential to enhance what kids are thinking about "definition" and its role, nature, and pur- pose in mathematical activity and discourse, which, after all, has been a major point this week. What should a definition do? Why is it needed? The following day, the teacher returned to the classroom and named the oddly even numbers the "Sean numbers." "He seemed pretty pleased," she wrote in her journal "and the others surprised." There might be multiple reasons for her deci- sion, from simply stating what she thought had happened to a social consideration of Sean's position in the class. Regardless of her intentions, on which I do not wish to speculate at length, I cannot help but wonder, how did Sheena feel? How did Mei feel? Sean had by far the most turns of any student to talk during the lesson (see Table 4.4) and many turns during the previous three lessons, including turns given by the teacher or other participants or taken by himself. The amount of time his voice occupied the public floor might have contributed to the impression that he was the initiator of, or the main contributor to, the emerging concept. I argue that naming the concept "Sean number" makes invisible the contributions of the other students who coconstructed it. It could have just as easily been attributed to Mei or Riba (see Figure 4.5). My analysis suggests that several students, including Sheena, Nathan, Betsy, Mei, and Riba, contributed work that became invisible with the making of the "fact" of Sean numbers. Were they pleased with the idea of Sean numbers too? Did they also assume that Sean "discovered" the idea? Did they recognize the teacher's action as an attempt to raise Sean's status by assigning competence? After all, his utterances in discussions may often have seemed unclear and were revoiced by other students. Or might they have attributed her naming the concept after Sean to their own invisibility, thus to some degree erasing their contributions to its development? "Sean numbers" had consequences in the classroom. "[O]ver the course of the next few days, some children explored patterns with Sean numbers, just as others were investigating patterns with even and odd numbers" (Ball, 1993, p. 187).p. 162 Tamar Posner 163 CONCLUDING REMARKS Analysis of classroom situations like this gives us the opportunity to acknowl- edge that many (if not all) ideas in the classroom-and in mathematical com- munities-are coconstructed. Indeed, in Ball's classroom, coconstruction was valued and encouraged. Reflections, justifications, and inquiry played major roles in learning and knowledge construction, and were held as core values in the class- room community. Moreover, this teacher practiced these values, not just among the students in her classroom but in the larger research and teaching community. In a reflexive act, aligned with her classroom practices, she opened her classroom to the eyes of many different communities, allowing, and even encouraging, various interpreta- tions of her own teaching. This courageous act provides researchers with a valu- able opportunity to analyze a classroom episode from different perspectives and with different tools. In addition, it provides teachers with an opportunity to think about how different pedagogical strategies can ensure equitable participation. In particular, the segments analyzed in this chapter suggest questions about the affor- dances of different classroom participation structures and different mathematical representations. From the perspective of social practice, "Sean numbers" cannot be seen only in terms of the teacher's intentions, because its unintended consequences (Giddens, 1979) went beyond the walls of this specific classroom. From the perspective of science studies, what matters is who, and under what conditions, took the attribu- tion of the concept to Sean to be true (Latour, 1986). This "lesson" to some extent became an "immutable mobile," and traveled far and across communities for over a decade, from the mathematics education community to the teacher education community and even to the mathematics community. It is now known as "Sean numbers," which was to some degree "black boxed" (Latour, 1987) as the "out- come" of the lesson. This "black boxing" erases the history of how the comment "six can be even and odd" became the hard fact of the "Sean numbers." Because this lesson is often used as an example of a mathematics lesson in teacher educa- tion programs across the country, one wonders about the unintended messages sent to those, primarily female, teachers. Is this example perpetuating the im- age of a sole male discoverer of mathematical knowledge? Was Sean's visibility achieved at the expense of other students' invisibility? Does it reinforce the invis- ibility of female contributions in mathematics? Did other students, such as Mei or Riba, get too little credit by not being named? Lampert and others argue that the goal of teaching mathematics should be "to bring the practice of knowing mathematics in school closer to what it means to know mathematics within the discipline" (Lampert, 1990). In this respect, par- ticipants in this classroom engaged in practices resembling those of the mathe- matical community. At this point a word of caution seems necessary. Although I agree with this goal, I also agree with Ball (1993, p. 377) that certain aspects of the discipline, such as "competitiveness among research mathematicians-p. 163 164 Equity in a Mathematics Classroom: An Exploration competitiveness for individual recognition, for resources, and for prestige-is hardly a desirable model for an elementary classroom." We need to be selective about the mathematical practices we introduce into the classroom, because some practices may perpetuate inequity. Attributing a "discovery" to an individual and naming it after that individual is not necessarily a desirable practice for an elementary classroom, even though it is done among mathematicians. In the scientific and mathematical communities, the processes of making "facts" are often erased, removed from "mathematics in the making," leaving a fact stripped of its history. Those processes might contribute to the impression that few women are mathematicians, and that even fewer have contributed in a significant way. Creating and naming a "fact" are political pro- cesses, and their examination can help us better understand how mathematics has been documented (Bowker & Star, 1999). Not all mathematical practices are desirable, and not all are equitable. More equi- table practices in elementary mathematics classrooms have two possible benefits: an immediate one for students in that classroom, and the possibility of those students' growing up to become members that help the mathematical community become more equitable. We recognize the importance of equity in society as a whole, and in the classroom in particular. However, detecting equity is difficult. This chapter presents examples of ways to analyze equity in day-to-day classroom interactions. Once inequity is detectable, our work to address equity issues can begin. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS As I emphasize in my chapter, no work is produced solely by an individual. This statement is definitely true in the development of this chapter. Cathy Kessel was instrumental in shaping and editing my drafts, and her skill and spirit are greatly appreciated. Thoughtful comments of Maria Ong, Natasha Schull, Tony Torralba, and the anonymous reviewers also contributed to this chapter. I especially thank Alan Schoenfeld for his insight and support, and Deborah Ball, who graciously shared her classroom and logs with a wide audience. I began working on this analysis several years ago in collaboration with Ilana Horn. We had many fruitful discussions and debates, which influenced my analysis; thank you, Lani. This chapter is dedicated to my dear friend and colleague, Mary Grantham- Campbell, who provided her own perspective on equity and relentlessly advocated for all children. She was the first person to review this chapter and, sadly, passed away before its publication. REFERENCES Ball, D. (1988).

And you saw that the fourth graders who have been thinking about this for a long time also disagree about it, don't they? 21 Mei: A Um, I h I thought that zero was always going to be a even number, but from the meeting I sort of got mixed up because I heard other ideas I agree with and now I don't know which one I should agree with. Unclear 36 Teacher: But he also said, I think, that all even numbers are made up of other even numbers. 37 Mei: I disagree. 69 Cassandra: I disagree with Sean when he says that six can be an odd number. I think six can't be an odd number because . .. look [she gets up and comes up to the board] D Unclear 137 Students: I disagree . . .I don't think so . . . 146 Teacher: Do other people agree with that? Is that what you're saying, Sean? 148 Teacher: Okay, do other people agree with him? [pause] Lin, you disagree with that? I P A D Yeah, I disagree with that because it's not according to like . . . here, can I show it on the board? 149 Lin: I D 156 Sean:    I disagree with myself... P D 172 Teacher: Are people following this disagreement? This is an important thing that I didn't even realize we were dis- agreeing about, so it's important to see if we can try to figure this one out. What are you going to show?p.

With a person (P) or idea (I) Disagree (D) or agree (A) 190 Lin: Yeah, I think I agree. I A 219 Teacher: Would somebody else like to come up and try a smaller number than twenty-one? Maybe one that everyone already agrees is odd? What's a number that everyone in the room already agrees is odd? Cassandra, what do you think is a number like that? 221 Teacher: Does everyone in the room agree that seventeen is odd? 234 Tembe: I agree and I have another way to do it. 237 Teacher: Again please? 238 Tembe: I agree and I have this other way to do it. A I A Unclear A Unclear A 251 Teacher: 252 Sean: Sean, what's your reaction to Ofala's definition? Unclear Urn, I'm not, I'm not-I disagree but, because um, I'm not, I'm not like using odd numbers to make them even and stuff, I'm using only even numbers to make them odd not, not. I'm not trying to make them but they can be odd, they can be odd . . . like ten and things like that.. . 293 Ofala: I don't agree that six can be odd. I D 298 Cassandra: I agree with her. And I have a question for Sean. If six is odd, then what is five? P 311 Riba: I disagree. Unclear 314 Teacher: Urn hm. Cassandra, you can sit down. Lin, you can sit down. Thanks. Ofala, I'll just have you stand there for 315 a minute since this is the definition you were suggesting, okay? Riba, what are you disagreeing with? Riba? What are you disagreeing with?

That's kind of like what I was going to say to him. Urn, what Sean said doesn't have to do with my conjecture. D P D A A Unclear P 325 Teacher: Okay, so you're disagreeing that it's the number of groups. And Sean, are you saying that the number of groups matters? 332 Tembe: I disagree with Sean. 337 Teacher: You don't agree with that? 344 Sheena I don't, I don't agree with that. 350 Ofala: I disagree with um- 351 Teacher: Sean. 352 Ofala:    with Sean that urn, you can't, you can turn an even, even number into an odd, because if you do, it will be like this [she uses her hand to cover one of the lines drawn on the board], they'llit'll just change that whole number and make it into a, an odd. P D 387 Teacher: Why would you like us to agree with you? Why would that be helpful if we all agreed that it was both odd and even? Can you convince us that that would be helpful? P I A 454 Bernadette Because urn, if, if we were just trying to talk about one number, then you'd want to know if, if we, if we were just agreeing on even numbers or just agreeing on special numbers or just agreeing on even and odd.

Are you agreeing with that or are you disagreeing with that? 473 Cassandra I agree. 474 Teacher What about you, Sean? A couple of times this week, you've had, you've taken a position that nobody else in the class agreed with. What does that make, does that make you change your mind, how does that make you feel? With a person (P) or idea (I) P Disagree (D) or agree (A) AD AD Unclear A A 475 Sean It makes me feel fine. 496 Teacher He said his mother, when his mother said it, it was a little more convincing because he can trust her a little bit more? What do the rest of you think when you, when you're trying to figure stuff out, do you agree or disagree with Sean? Or what do you think about that? Maybe nobody has a comment about that. I don't know. Lin, what do you think? AD Urn, I agree with Sean because you usually trust your mom because you live with your mom all those years. So you mustso you might trust your mom more than like the rest of the class becauseor other peoplebe- cause you haven't been with them. Maybe you've been with them as long you can remember, but not when you were just born like, your mom has been with you since you just born. 497 Lin 499 Sheena I think was something urnurn, I forgot what it was but this year I tried to get me to convince her about some- thing that theyshe didn't agree with me, she said that, that isn't it, so then finally I convinced her that it was it. . . 503 Ofala Urn, he agreed.
