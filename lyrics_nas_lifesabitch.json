Yeah, yeah\nAyo, put the Grants over there in the safe\nYou know what I'm sayin'?\n\u2018Cause we spendin' these Jacksons\nThe Washingtons go to wifey, you know how that go\nI'm sayin' that's what this is all about, right?\nClothes, bankrolls, and hoes\nYou know what I'm sayin'?\nYo, then what, man, what?!\n\n[Verse 1: AZ]\nVisualizin' the realism of life in actuality\nFuck who's the baddest, a person's status depends on salary\nAnd my mentality is money-orientated\nI'm destined to live the dream for all my peeps who never made it\n\u2018Cause yeah, we were beginners in the hood as Five Percenters\nBut somethin' must've got in us, \u2018cause all of us turned to sinners\nNow some restin' in peace and some are sittin' in San Quentin\nOthers, such as myself, are tryin' to carry on tradition\nKeepin' this Schweppervescent street ghetto essence inside us\n'Cause it provides us with the proper insight to guide us\nEven though we know, somehow we all gotta go\nBut as long as we leavin' thievin'\nWe'll be leavin' with some kind of dough\nSo, until that day we expire and turn to vapors\nMe and my capers will be somewhere stackin' plenty papers\nKeepin' it real, packin' steel, gettin' high\n\u2018Cause life's a bitch and then you die\n\n[Chorus: AZ]\nLife's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high\n\u2018Cause you never know when you're gonna go\nLife's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye\n\u2018Cause you never know when you're gonna go\nLife's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high\n\u2018Cause you never know when you're gonna go\nLife's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye\n\n[Verse 2: Nas]\nI woke up early on my born day; I'm 20, it's a blessin'\nThe essence of adolescence leaves my body, now I'm fresh and\nMy physical frame is celebrated \u2018cause I made it\nOne quarter through life, some godly-like thing created\nGot rhymes 365 days annual, plus some\nLoad up the mic and bust one, cuss while I pus from\nMy skull, \u2018cause it's pain in my brain vein, money maintain\nDon't go against the grain, simple and plain\nWhen I was young at this I used to do my thing hard\nRobbin' foreigners, take they wallets, they jewels and rip they green cards\nDipped to the projects, flashin' my quick cash\nAnd got my first piece of ass, smokin' blunts with hash\nNow it's all about cash in abundance\nNiggas I used to run with is rich or doin' years in the hundreds\nI switched my motto; instead of sayin', \"Fuck tomorrow!\"\nThat buck that bought a bottle could've struck the lotto\nOnce I stood on the block, loose cracks produce stacks\nI cooked up and cut small pieces to get my loot back\nTime is illmatic, keep static like wool fabric\nPack a 4-matic to crack your whole cabbage\n\n[Chorus: AZ]\nLife's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high\n\u2018Cause you never know when you're gonna go\nLife's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye\n\u2018Cause you never know when you're gonna go\nLife's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high\n\u2018Cause you never know when you're gonna go\nLife's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye\n\u2018Cause you never know when you're gonna go\nLife's a bitch and then you die\n\n[Trumpet Outro: Olu Dara]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ec6608c57f4dfcb0453cfb23a2fcda2c.800x800x1.png"}], "artist": "Nas"}
