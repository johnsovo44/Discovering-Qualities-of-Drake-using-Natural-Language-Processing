It allows you to insert in an artist, determine how many songs you would like based off popularity or title. I chose to go with the top 10 songs by popularity according to the Genius API. Ultimately I felt this was appropriate because it will allows us to understand the artist the way the general public understands them. Obscure songs would probably give us a distorted view. \n",
